        <p>Let's say you've inherited a Python 2 web app. You've already tried Python 3 and you know it's better than nutella on oreos. You know you need to switch. You already have that on your roadmap. But before that happens, there's this task that requires you to build a fresh new module and deploy it to your existing servers.</p>

In order to facilitate this, we need to keep track of our monthly performance.

Sure, I had been working for some years prior to that, but it had almost always been along the lines of working from home and working on my own terms. I was excited and somewhat worried. I remembered my first office job: I was for the most part...</p>
