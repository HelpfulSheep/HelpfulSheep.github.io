                <p>Web testing automation is probably the use case Selenium has become most known for. And for good reason. It allows you to take full control of the browser of your choice and interact with the underlying web page in very reliable ways (think <code>document.querySelector('h1')</code> versus parsing out the page's HTML).</p>
